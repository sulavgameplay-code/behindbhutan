    <p class="section-text">
	'Bhutan Behind the Curtain' by Balaraam Poudyal, a vivid confluence of history and memoir, brings to the surface the long-concealed secrets of Bhutan's past. With narrative integrity and factual precision, the work documents Bhutan's political and social history as a modern state-tracing the arrival and settlement of the Nepali-speaking community and the role they played in the country's development, security and administration. It also lays bare the chasm between the romanticized myths often heard about Bhutan and the lived realities of its persecuted citizens. 
    </p>
    <p class="section-text">
      This compelling account chronicles the state-sponsored persecution of Nepali-speaking Bhutanese, which began in the mid-twentieth century and reached its most brutal and inhumane expression in the 1990s. It follows the tragic trajectory of forced expulsion, the immense suffering endured in exile, the deprivations of life in refugee camps in Nepal, and the regional and multilateral efforts aimed at resolving the crisis. The narrative further reflects on the process of third-country resettlement, while drawing attention to the many unresolved injustices that continue to demand redress. 
    </p>
    <p class="section-text">
      As a direct victim of expulsion, the current president of the Bhutan Peoples' Party, and a leading figure in efforts to address the Bhutanese political and refugee crisis, the author speaks not only as a chronicler of history, but also as one who has long stood at the heart of its struggle. His voice imbues this work with authenticity, moral authority and credibility.
